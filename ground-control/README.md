Please do not push directly to this repo. Fork it, push your changes there, and make a pull request (PR).

Ideally PRs should be reviewed by at least one other person before merging.

Please work on a feature branch (create one if one doesn't exist) and only push to that branch. **Please do not directly push to `main` or `dev`!** Once features are stable we can merge them into `dev`. Once `dev` is stable we can merge it into `main` as a release.
