# BSLI IREC Ground Control

Ground Control software for the BSLI IREC (International Rocket Engineering Competition) team.

This Ground Control software is designed to interface with the Flight Software found here: https://github.com/osu-bsli/flight-software

**GROUND CONTROL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE SAFETY-CRITICAL. SRAD PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT DOES NOT INVOLVE THIS SOFTWARE.**

## Notes
* Currently telemetry-only.
* Arming of the SRAD parachute deployment mechanism is done with a physical key on the rocket.
